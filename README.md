# -Credit-Card-Approval-Predictor


Numerous credit card applications are received by commercial banks. Many of them are turned down for a variety of reasons, such as excessive credit record requests, poor income, or large loan balances. Because time is money, manually assessing these apps is tedious, prone to errors, and time-consuming. Fortunately, machine learning can be used to automate this operation, and most commercial banks already do so. In this project, you will use machine learning techniques to create an automatic credit card approval predictor, exactly like banks do.
